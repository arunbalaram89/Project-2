Projec ETL - Miniproject - Arun Balaram


Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline using Python, pandas and then transforming the dataframes Once completedd, we then used Postgres SQL and Quick DBD to create an ERD Diagram along with Table Schemas. Each member created a Jupyter Notebook from each of the 4 databases that had to be created. Once completed, all 4 notebooks were merged into 1 notebook. An ERD Diagram was created to connect all 4 databases uses Quick DBD.

Project Description
(Provide more detailed overview of the project. Talk a bit about your data sources and what questions and hypothesis you are exploring. What specific data analysis/visualization and modelling work are you using to solve the problem? What blockers and challenges are you facing? Feel free to number or bullet point things here)

The data was very messy, and had to be cleaned. Ex. the dates were timestamps, the contact dataframe was all in 1 column. We had to split the category and subcategory data. The first thing was find out the data types in each column of each dataframe. Then we changed some column's datatype to better analyze the data. For the category and subcategory, after splitting the columns

Clone this repo

Raw Data is being kept [here](Repo folder containing raw data) within this repo.

If using offline data mention that and how they may obtain the data from the froup)

Data processing/transformation scripts are being kept [here](Repo folder containing data processing scripts/notebooks)

In this project, attached are 4 csv files from the 4 dataframes created. Also attached is the ERD Diagram explaining the relationships, along with the primary and foreign keys.
