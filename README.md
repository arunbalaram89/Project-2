Project Intro/Objective
The purpose of this project is to build an ETL pipeline using Python, pandas and then transforming the dataframes Once completedd, we then used Postgres SQL and Quick DBD to create an ERD Diagram along with Table Schemas. Each member created a Jupyter Notebook from each of the 4 databases that had to be created. Once completed, all 4 notebooks were merged into 1 notebook. An ERD Diagram was created to connect all 4 databases uses Quick DBD.

Project Description

The data was very messy, and had to be cleaned. Ex. the dates were timestamps, the contact dataframe was all in 1 column. We had to split the category and subcategory data. The first thing was find out the data types in each column of each dataframe. Then we changed some column's datatype to better analyze the data. For the category and subcategory, after splitting the columns
